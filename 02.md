This chapter covers everything you need to begin building mobile applications using React Native. You'll learn about installing essential tools like Node.js and npm, the differences between React Native CLI and Expo CLI, setting up VS Code, and building your first app on an emulator and the web. This foundation ensures your environment is configured correctly to support advanced development in later chapters.

React Native enables developers to create mobile apps for iOS and Android using JavaScript. To build and test these applications, you need a properly configured environment. This includes runtime engines, a code editor, and a project scaffolding tool, such as Expo or the React Native Command-Line Interface (CLI). Setting up properly can save hours of debugging and streamline your development process.

## Node.js and npm

Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime based on Chrome's V8 engine. It allows developers to execute JavaScript outside of a browser, which is essential for running development servers, bundlers, and command-line interface (CLI) tools used in React Native.

npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. It is used to:

- Install packages like React Native, Expo, and development tools.
- Manage dependencies and scripts within your project.
- Maintain version consistency.

- Go to 
- Download the LTS version (Long-Term Support).
- Follow your system’s installation process.
- Verify installation:

[language=bash,style=terminal]
node -v
npm -v

**Developer Tip:** Use  (Node Version Manager) if you plan to work on multiple projects requiring different versions of Node.js.

## React Native CLI vs Expo CLI

When starting a new **React Native** project, developers typically choose between two primary tools: the **React Native CLI** and the **Expo CLI**. Each option caters to different levels of project complexity and developer experience. The **React Native CLI** provides direct access to **native Android and iOS code**, making it ideal for applications that require **custom native modules**, **advanced background processing**, or integration with **third-party SDKs** not supported by default. This approach offers complete control over the app’s build process and native codebase, but demands a more complex setup, including configuring Android Studio and Xcode, and manually managing platform-specific dependencies.

In contrast, the **Expo CLI** simplifies development by offering a **managed workflow** with a set of **built-in APIs** and tools. Developers using Expo benefit from **rapid setup**, **consistent cross-platform behavior**, and access to features like **camera**, **location**, **notifications**, and **sensors** without needing to write native code. Expo is particularly well-suited for **prototypes**, **MVPs**, and apps that don’t require deep native integration. Additionally, it supports **Over-the-Air (OTA) updates** and **cloud-based builds** through **Expo Application Services (EAS)**, further streamlining the **deployment process**. However, developers needing custom native functionality must \textquotedblleft**eject** from Expo, which then shifts the project into a more complex setup similar to the React Native CLI.

Ultimately, the decision between the two CLIs depends on the project’s requirements. For simple, **fast-to-market apps** that stay within Expo’s ecosystem, the **Expo CLI** offers an excellent experience. On the other hand, projects that demand **flexibility**, **native code control**, or **advanced integrations** are better served by the **React Native CLI**.

The **React Native CLI** provides developers **full access to native platform features**, making it a powerful choice for building complex mobile applications. It is especially suitable for projects that require the integration of **platform-specific APIs**, development of **custom native modules**, or use of **third-party libraries** that involve native code and require manual linking. This level of control enables developers to tailor the app’s behavior and performance to the specific needs of each platform. However, this flexibility comes at the cost of a more involved setup process. 

The React Native CLI requires the **manual installation and configuration** of development environments such as **Android Studio** for Android and **Xcode** for iOS. This setup process involves managing emulators, SDKs, and other native dependencies, which can be challenging for beginners but are essential for applications that require deep native functionality. To run the command:

 [language=bash,style=terminal]
npx react-native init MyProject

The **Expo CLI** is designed to streamline the development process by offering a **managed workflow** that abstracts much of the native code complexity. It comes with a suite of **preconfigured tools and APIs**, allowing developers to build high-quality mobile applications without requiring in-depth knowledge of native platforms like Android or iOS. One of the most significant advantages of Expo is that it enables developers to work with **zero native code**, making it particularly suitable for beginners, small teams, or rapid prototyping. This managed approach significantly reduces setup time and the risk of platform-specific bugs.

A significant strength of Expo lies in its collection of **built-in APIs**, which provide out-of-the-box support for essential mobile functionalities including **camera access**, **geolocation**, **push notifications**, and **device sensors**. These features can be used immediately with minimal configuration, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than managing native dependencies. Additionally, Expo integrates well with tools like the Expo Go app, enabling real-time previews and testing across devices.

 [language=bash,style=terminal]
npx create-expo-app MyApp

This command scaffolds a new Expo project with all necessary configurations, making it one of the easiest ways to begin developing React Native applications. Overall, Expo CLI is a valuable choice for projects that prioritize speed, ease of development, and cross-platform consistency, especially when native customization is not required.

## Visual Studio Code Setup

**Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** is a highly popular, lightweight, and extensible source-code editor developed by Microsoft. It is particularly well-suited for **JavaScript**, **React**, and **React Native** development, offering rich language support, integrated Git control, intelligent code completion (IntelliSense), debugging capabilities, and a vibrant ecosystem of extensions. Its seamless integration with development tools and customizable interface make it an ideal choice for both beginners and experienced developers.

To get started, download the editor from . Once installed, enhance the development environment by adding key extensions that improve productivity and code quality. The **React Native Tools** extension provides debugging, IntelliSense, and commands specific to React Native. **Prettier** ensures consistent code formatting, while **ESLint** enforces JavaScript coding standards. **Path Intellisense** offers intelligent autocompletion for file paths, and **Bracket Pair Colorizer** visually distinguishes matching brackets for improved code readability.

Next, configure VS Code settings to align with your coding preferences. It is recommended to **enable format on save** to automatically apply Prettier’s formatting rules whenever you save a file. Customize the **tab spacing**, **font**, and **themes** for a personalized experience. For project-specific configurations, create or edit the  file, which allows fine-grained control over editor behavior within your workspace.

Finally, leverage the **integrated terminal** in VS Code to run essential development commands such as  for React Native CLI or  for Expo projects. This integration allows developers to code, test, and debug all within a single environment, greatly enhancing workflow efficiency.

## Creating Your First App with Expo CLI

To begin a new React Native project with Expo, you use the  tool, which scaffolds a new project with a basic structure and preconfigured settings. Open a terminal and run the following commands:

[language=bash,style=terminal]
npx create-expo-app myFirstApp
cd myFirstApp
npm start

The first command creates a new directory called  with all the necessary files to begin development. Navigating into the directory, you then run  to launch the **Expo Dev Server**, which provides an interactive development environment including a QR code for mobile preview, logs, and platform-specific run options. This step is crucial because it prepares your workspace and sets up tools like hot reloading and debugging out-of-the-box.

Understanding the default folder structure helps you navigate and organize your code efficiently:

  - : This is the **entry point** of your application and the root component where the app logic begins. You can think of it like the  function in other programming languages.
  - : A folder to store **static resources** such as images, fonts, or audio files. Assets in this folder can be easily imported into components using Expo's asset system.
  - : This directory contains all the **installed dependencies and packages**, managed by npm. You generally don’t modify anything here manually.
  - : This is the **manifest file** for your project. It lists your project’s metadata, dependencies, and useful npm scripts like , , and .
  - : A configuration file for **Babel**, the JavaScript compiler that allows you to use modern JavaScript syntax and transforms your code for broader browser compatibility.

Once your development server is running, you can preview your app using various methods:

**Option 1: Android Emulator**

  - Open **AVD (Android Virtual Device) Manager** in Android Studio.
  - Start a configured emulator and return to your terminal or Expo Dev Tools. Press the  key to launch the app on the emulator.
  - This is useful for testing app behavior on a virtual Android device without needing physical hardware.

**Option 2: Physical Device**

  - Install the **Expo Go** app from the Play Store or App Store.
  - When you run , a QR code appears in the terminal or browser window (Expo Dev Tools).
  - Open Expo Go on your mobile device and scan the QR code to launch the app. This provides a fast and accurate way to test on real hardware, especially helpful for checking gestures, camera, or sensors.

**Option 3: Web Browser**

  - Press the  key in the terminal or choose the "Run in web browser" option in Expo Dev Tools.
  - This will launch a web version of your app using **React Native for Web**, useful for development on platforms like Chromebooks or when you don't have mobile access.

React Native and Expo support **Fast Refresh**, a feature that enables real-time updates in the app when code changes are saved. To test this, open , modify some text or component structure, save the file, and observe the changes reflected instantly on your connected emulator, device, or browser.

This capability is handy for accelerating development, as it eliminates the need to recompile or rebuild the app with every change. You can iterate quickly and focus on functionality without interrupting your workflow.

## Best Practices

Adopting a set of consistent best practices can greatly improve the quality, maintainability, and scalability of a React Native project. 

  - **Use Expo for prototyping, then eject to bare workflow for native modules:** Expo provides a fast and convenient way to prototype applications. However, for production apps requiring native modules not supported by Expo, it is recommended to eject to the *bare workflow*, which provides full control over native code.

  - **Write modular, reusable components:** Breaking the UI into small, self-contained components makes the codebase easier to manage, debug, and reuse across screens or projects. This modular approach enhances maintainability and collaboration.

  - **Follow naming conventions:** Use *PascalCase* for React components (e.g., ) and *camelCase* for variables and functions (e.g., ). Adhering to consistent naming improves readability and aligns with community standards.

  - **Use version control (e.g., Git):** Track changes in your project using Git or another version control system. This enables collaboration, rollback of code changes, and safer experimentation with new features.

  - **Test on multiple devices to detect platform-specific issues:** Mobile environments vary by OS, device size, and hardware capabilities. Always test on both Android and iOS, using real devices and emulators, to catch layout bugs, performance issues, or permission-related errors.

React Native development can occasionally present platform-specific issues or environment misconfigurations. The following table outlines common problems and their solutions:

{|p{5.5cm}|p{8.5cm}|}
\hline
**Issue** & **Solution** \\
\hline
CLI command not recognized & Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed, and that their executable paths are correctly added to the system's  variable. Restart the terminal if changes were made. \\
\hline
Emulator not launching & Verify that Android Studio's AVD (Android Virtual Device) is installed and configured correctly. On Intel-based systems, confirm that HAXM (Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager) is enabled. \\
\hline
Permission error on install & Some packages require elevated privileges during installation. Use  on Unix systems or run the terminal as an administrator on Windows. \\
\hline
App not found on device & Make sure your development machine and the physical device are connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Check for any firewall or router restrictions that may block local connections. \\
\hline
Hot reload not working & Restart the Metro bundler or disable/re-enable **Fast Refresh** via the developer menu. In some cases, clearing the cache using  can resolve update issues. \\
