## Teaching & learning methods

Lectures, labs, project-based learning, peer reviews, presentations, and reflective practice. Expect weekly hands-on coding with RN/Expo.&#x20;

## Policies (key points)

* **Attendance**: ≥80% to sit the final.
* **Late work**: Penalized unless pre-approved.
* **Academic integrity**: Plagiarism/cheating → disciplinary action.
* **Comms**: Check LMS & email regularly.&#x20;

## Quick start checklist (suggested)

* Install **Node.js (LTS)**, **npm**, **Expo CLI**, **VS Code**, Android/iOS emulator.
* Create a starter app with **Expo**; practice components, styling, navigation.
* Set up **Axios** and hit a simple public API (e.g., GET list, show via `FlatList`).
* Form a team early; draft **wireframes** and a brief feature scope for the final project.&#x20;

If you’d like, I can turn this into a one-page printable or set up a milestone checklist you can tick off week by week.
