# **2. Types of Mobile Applications**

| Type | Speed | Hardware Access | Cost | Flexibility |
|------|:----:|:---------------:|:----:|:------------:|
| Native | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚úÖ Full | üí∞ High | Low |
| Hybrid | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚öôÔ∏è Partial | üí∞ Medium | Medium |
| Web/PWA | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚ùå Limited | üí∞ Low | High |

---

# **Native Applications**

- Built with platform-specific languages:  
  - **Swift / Objective-C** (iOS)  
  - **Kotlin / Java** (Android)  
- Best performance and UX.  
- Access to all device features.  
- High development & maintenance cost.

---

# **Hybrid Applications**
